## 03 — YouTube Homepage Clone ✅

A static clone of the YouTube homepage built using **HTML & CSS only**.

### ✅ What I practiced
- Semantic HTML structure
- CSS Flexbox & Grid
- Fixed header and sidebar layouts
- Nested layouts (thumbnail + video info grid)
- Tooltips and hover states
- Responsive spacing and alignment
- Clean CSS file separation:
  - `general.css`
  - `header.css`
  - `video.css`
  - `sidebar.css`

### 📌 Project Status
**Completed (HTML & CSS learning goal achieved).**  
This project served as a foundation to become comfortable with layout, structure, and styling before moving on to JavaScript.

No JavaScript functionality is included by design.

✅ **Next step:** JavaScript fundamentals and DOM manipulation.
